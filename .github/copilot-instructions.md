# Copilot Instructions for Financial_Summary

## Project Overview
This is a **Chinese-language financial investment knowledge repository** focused on understanding industry and company selection strategies in the AI sector. The content is educational and research-oriented, not a software project.

## Content Structure

### Core Files
- **README.md**: Project title and brief description (简体中文)
- **如何选择行业.md** (How to Choose Industries): Industry landscape analysis for AI era
  - GPU + TPU infrastructure layer
  - Storage chip industry (memory, SSD) key players
  - Power/electrical grid equipment layer
  - Precious metals (copper, silver, gold)
- **如何选择公司.md** (How to Choose Companies): Company selection framework (currently empty template)

## Content Guidelines

### Language & Style
- Content is in **Simplified Chinese (简体中文)**
- Target audience: Individual investors researching AI sector opportunities
- Focus on strategic thinking and rationale ("why" matters more than "what")

### Investment Analysis Pattern (from 如何选择行业.md)
When analyzing sectors, use this structure:
1. **Critical infrastructure layer** - what enables the technology (GPUs, TPUs, chips)
2. **Support systems** - power, storage, materials needed at scale
3. **Key players** - identify market leaders and competitive landscape
4. **Strategic reasoning** - explain the "why" for each choice

### Information Architecture
- Organize by **industry/company level**, then by **strategic importance**
- Use markdown hierarchy clearly (H1 for major sections, H2 for subsections)
- Bullet points for lists; numbered lists for priority/sequence only
- Include reasoning/context for recommendations, not just lists

## AI Assistant Guidance

### When Expanding Content
- Research actual market conditions (use current knowledge cutoff)
- Add specific company names, market share data, and recent developments
- Explain investment theses - what makes each recommendation compelling?
- Cite strategic advantages and competitive moats where relevant

### When Creating New Analysis Files
- Follow the existing pattern: *How to Choose X* (如何选择X)
- Structure: Strategic landscape → Key players → Investment thesis
- Use bilingual section headers when introducing new concepts

### Avoid
- Unsourced claims or speculation presented as fact
- Generic investment advice without sector-specific context
- Over-technical explanations (keep for educated investors, not specialists)

## File Management
- All content in markdown (.md) format
- Use UTF-8 encoding to preserve Chinese characters
- Filenames in Chinese allowed (reflects content audience)
